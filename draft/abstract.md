博弈无处不在，从剪刀石头布到国家间的外交，只要双方在一定的规则框架下存在利益冲突，就会产生博弈。而在人工智能领域，博弈一直被视为极具挑战性的课题，而棋类游戏作为人类博弈智慧的高地，很多时候成为检验博弈算法的平台。从1997年的IBM深蓝，到2017年DeepMind的AlphaZero；从alpha-beta剪枝，到强化学习，人工智能已经在博弈问题上展现超出人类的智慧。本文在AlphaZero的基础上，提出了一种更适用于中国象棋的强化学习算法，并在与人类玩家以及其他博弈算法（原AlphaZero算法）的对抗中表现优秀，展示出来较高的智能。

Games are everywhere, from rock-paper-scissors to diplomacy between countries, as long as there is a conflict of interest between the two parties within a certain framework of rules, a game will arise. In the field of artificial intelligence, gaming has always been regarded as a very challenging topic, and board games, as the high ground of human gaming wisdom, often become a platform for testing game algorithms. From IBM Deep Blue in 1997 to DeepMind's AlphaZero in 2017; from alpha-beta pruning to reinforcement learning, artificial intelligence has demonstrated intelligence beyond human beings in game problems. Based on AlphaZero, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm that is more suitable for Chinese chess, and it performs well in the confrontation with human players and other game algorithms (the original AlphaZero algorithm), showing higher intelligence.
